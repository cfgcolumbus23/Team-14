# Team-14

Test taking software allowing users to sign in and take tests and complete lessons for incentives. 

Note: We attempted to implement a database with student information but our queries were all failing and none of the 
SMEs were able to help us so we moved the files manipulating the database and moved those to the folder server/server-legacy. 
We then used dummy data so that our front end could actually function and we implemented a dummy backend.
